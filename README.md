**st - simple terminal**
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

**Requirements**
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


**Installation**
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st:

Take special care while patching st, some patches could give you errors.
So you would need to patch them manually.
```
patch -p1 < st-patch # Use this syntax for each patch.
make clean install
```

**Running st**
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
